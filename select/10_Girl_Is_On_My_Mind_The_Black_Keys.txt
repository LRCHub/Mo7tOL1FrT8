Girl is on my mind
Try ignore, try to unwind,
But she is on my mind
Eyes are in my eyes
Where I've been, how time flies,
When she is in my eyes
See her standing there
She's gentle now, and takes great care
See her standing there
Hold me close to you
Not one thing, that I would not do
If you hold me close to you
Girl is on my mind
